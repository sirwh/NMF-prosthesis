# NMF-prosthesis

This project includes a model of prosthesis training and testing.
The prosthesis is driven by EMG (EMG is recorded by a g.tec device which is necessary for running the model).
NMF algoithm is used to recognize the four kinds of hand/wrist movements: open, close, pronate, supinate.
First, run the model to train these movements.
After the training is completed, run the model again to test.
The NMF algorithm should be able to recognize the amplitude of the movements. Different movements can be combined.
